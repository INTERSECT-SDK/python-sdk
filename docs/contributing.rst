This section discusses linters, formatters, and style guides for the INTERSECT Python SDK.

Linting
-------

Use the `flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_ linter tool when writing Python code. Instructions for setting up flake8 with Visual Studio Code are available `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting>`__. Instructions for setting up flake8 with Sublime Text are available `here <https://lsp.sublimetext.io/>`__ for the LSP-pylsp package.

Formatting
----------

Use the `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ formatter for Python code. Instructions for using this formatter with Visual Studio Code are available `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing>`__. Instructions for using the formatter with Sublime Text are available `here <https://lsp.sublimetext.io/>`__ for the LSP-pylsp package.

Docstrings
----------

Docstrings for Python classes, functions, and modules should adhere to the `Google style <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_. The docstrings are processed by the `napoleon extension <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for the Sphinx generated documentation.
