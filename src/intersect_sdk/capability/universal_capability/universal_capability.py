A Client should be able to reliably set the operation of a request to point to this function, regardless of the Service they want to talk to.

NOTE: While users should generally not need to ever import this class directly, it SHOULD remain stable. Therefore, it does NOT belong in `_internal`, which does not have a stability guarantee.
