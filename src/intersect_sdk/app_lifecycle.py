"""This module defines some generic lifecycle utilities users can implement for themselves. Both Clients and Services can use these utilities, but they should be considered optional.

It IS essential for an application to be able to shut down gracefully, as the adapter can communicate
to the broader INTERSECT ecosystem that they have shut down. Obviously, not all shutdowns can be detected.

However - classes and functions in this module are not essential towards an adapter functioning properly.
If you're using something with its own lifecycle, you can safely ignore this module and implement
the calls to the adapter lifecycle functions yourself.

For example, it's possible to integrate an INTERSECT adapter with a FastAPI web server. Since FastAPI
already manages its own lifecycles, you should integrate your adapter with FastAPI manually,
and let FastAPI handle lifecycles.
