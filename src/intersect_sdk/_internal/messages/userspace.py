"""This module contains core messaging definitions relating to user-defined functions.

This module is internal-facing and should not be used directly by users.

Services have two associated channels which handle userspace messages: their request channel
and their response channel. Services always CONSUME messages from these channels, but never PRODUCE messages
on these channels. (A message is always sent in the receiver's namespace).

The response channel is how the service handles external requests, the request channel is used when this service itself
needs to make external requests through INTERSECT.

Services should ALWAYS be CONSUMING from their userspace channel.
They should NEVER be PRODUCING messages on their userspace channel.

Clients should be CONSUMING from their userspace channel, but should only get messages
from services they explicitly messaged.
