"""The various configuration classes in this module need to be defined by users, often during runtime, to provide needed parameters for your Service or Client to function.

Many of these values should come from config files, environment variables, or command-line arguments.

The configuration classes all rely on extensive validation in an attempt to catch errors as early as possible.
It's best to catch all configuration errors prior to sending or receiving any messages.

Configuration classes are the most likely thing to "break" following a version update.
