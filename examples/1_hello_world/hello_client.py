    As we don't want to engage in a back-and-forth, we simply throw an exception to break out of the message loop.
    Ways to continue listening to messages or sending messages will be explored in other examples.

    Params:
      _source: the source of the response message. In this case it will always be from the hello_service.
      _operation: the name of the function we called in the original message. In this case it will always be "say_hello_to_name".
      _has_error: Boolean value which represents an error. Since there is never an error in this example, it will always be "False".
      payload: Value of the response from the Service. The typing of the payload varies, based on the operation called and whether or not
        _has_error was set to "True". In this case, since we do not have an error, we can defer to the operation's response type. This response type is
        "str", so the type will be "str". The value will always be "Hello, hello_client!".

        Note that the payload will always be a deserialized Python object, but the types are fairly limited: str, bool, float, int, None, List[T], and Dict[str, T]
        are the only types the payload can have. "T" in this case can be any of the 7 types just mentioned.
